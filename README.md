# TERA: Deadlock-free Routing for Full-mesh Networks Without Virtual Channels

TERA (Topology-Embedded Routing Algorithm) is a novel deadlock-free routing algorithm for Full-mesh networks. It avoids the need for Virtual Channels (VCs) and achieves higher performance under adversarial and real-application traffic scenarios than other routing alternatives with the same resources.

This repository contains all code, configuration files, and documentation needed to **reproduce the results** in our paper:
